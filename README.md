# YOWL - A Restaurant Review Application

Create the Yowl databases and navigate to your local host.

## Project Overview

This Project was done at Makers Acadmey as the second team project. It's aim was to introduce the team to Rails (which represented a return to Ruby after a few weeks of Javascript). The aim of the project was to create a restaurant reviews app similar to [Yelp](https://www.yelp.co.uk/london).

The project was done in a team of four over 4 and a half days.

## Successes

* We worked hard to maintain stand-ups/retros and to keep pairing tasks focussed on User Stories.
* Identifying concurrent tasks for pairs and then integrating the work into the Master.
* Integrating design and Bootstrap into the project.
* Strong use of documentation to harness the power of Rails.

## Challenges

* Understanding everything Rails had created and how this tied together was the constant challenge.
* This was only the second team-project attempted and integrating features (ie sign in/sign out) with other existing features took a lot of communication between pairs and took up a lot of time.

## Built with

* [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/)
* [Minitest](http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.0.0/libdoc/minitest/rdoc/MiniTest.html)
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
